## 📏 Model
The model of LMD-ViT is available at this [URL](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JU2U7fxZkWzNPGhxvzhQmHDmzu0JFLqC?usp=drive_link)

## 🚀 Quick Inference
### Environment

Before inferencing LMD-ViT, please install the environment on Linux:

```
pip install -U pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Create a folder named "ckpt" and another folder named "val_data":
```
cd LMD-ViT
mkdir ckpt
mkdir val_data
```
Put the downloaded model in the "ckpt" folder.

Prepare the evaluation data in the form of ".npy" and put them in the "val_data" folder.

### Inference

You can evaluate the LMD-ViT by using:
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python test.py
```
## 📌 TODO
- [ ] Further improve the performances. 
- [ ] Release the training code.
